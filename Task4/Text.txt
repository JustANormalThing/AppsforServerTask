Youkai of the Dusk
Rumia

Ability: Manipulating darkness


Stage 1 boss. A youkai.

She is of no importance to the story, and isn't up to anything in particular in her life. The ribbon tied to her hair is actually a charm; she can't touch it even though there have been times when she wanted to take it off.

There is no evidence of her ability to manipulate darkness in the game, but in truth, places around her are always as dark as night.

Total of three card attacks.
